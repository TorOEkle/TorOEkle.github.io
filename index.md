# About me

I am an economist with a strong focus on digitalization and analytics, particularly in harnessing the transformative potential of graph databases. While I once aspired to become a true OLS Engineer, latetely I have worked Neo4j (graph database) which has quickly become my favorite technology. The tech stach I currently work with is **Python**, **Dagster**, **DuckDB**, **Neo4j** and **GraphQL** with DevOp tools like **ArgoCD** and **OpenShift**

I hold a **Master's degree in Economic Theory and Econometrics** from the **University of Oslo**, and I also have a background in **Industrial Mechanics** and **Mechanical Engineering:** operations and maintenance.

I enjoy diving deep into interesting analyses and use GitHub as a space to store personal projects while constantly pushing myself to learn new things. Recently, I have developed an interest in **Julia** and **time-series databases**, expanding my expertise alongside my work with graph databases.

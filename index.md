# About me

I am an economist with a strong focus on digitalization and analytics, particularly in harnessing the transformative potential of graph databases. While I once aspired to become a true OLS Engineer, latetely I have worked Neo4j (graph database) which has quickly become my favorite technology. The tech stach I currently work with is **Python**, **Dagster**, **DuckDB**, **Neo4j** and **GraphQL** with DevOp tools like **ArgoCD** and **OpenShift**. 

I hold a **Master's degree in Economic Theory and Econometrics** from the **University of Oslo**, and I also have a background in **Industrial Mechanics** and **Mechanical Engineering:** operations and maintenance. Before I entered tech industry I worked eight years in oil and gas as engineer as field engineer. 

I enjoy diving deep into interesting analyses and use GitHub as a space to store personal projects while constantly pushing myself to learn new things. Recently, I have developed an interest in **Julia** and **time-series databases**, expanding my expertise alongside my work with graph databases.




# Projects

## Time series
Time series. [QuestDB + Graphana](https://github.com/TorOEkle/time-series)

## Julia and electricity Markets
I find electricity markets interesting and this [Course on Electricity Markets](https://mreguant.github.io/em-course/) was a good opportunity to combine that with learning Julia.

# Skeleton project
Here I wish to set up a skeleton project of the tech stack I have worked most with. **Dagster** as orchestration tool for ETL with Python, **Neo4j** as database and **GraphQL** as API.
